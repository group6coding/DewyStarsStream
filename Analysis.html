        <h1>Summary of Stream</h1>
        <p>During the first quarter, a livestream of Dewy Star discussed the English research topic titled Get Ready With Us. The second quarter was set to begin with a scheduled stream on February 22. To promote it, we put up posters at school, sent promotions via Gmail, and shared them on TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook and in physical copies. However, due to the sportsfest, the stream got postponed from February 22 to February 28. The livestream lasted approximately one hour and one minute, reaching a maximum of 85 viewers. While the broadcast had many benefits and attracted a good number of viewers, there were still areas that could be improved.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="Acardcontent3">
            <div class="Aimg2"></div>
            <h1>Stream Advantages</h1>
            <p>Good Internet Connection
                There are no internet connection problems and lags that are encountered throughout the whole stream. The stream was able to maintain a high-resolution connection from the start until the end of the stream.
                <br>
                <br>
                Good Quality
                The stream video is clear, and the viewers were able to see the game and layouts clearly.
                <br>
                <br>
                Good Audio Quality
                The audio of the stream is clear. The viewers were able to hear the sound of the game and our discussions clearly.

                <h1>Areas of Opportunities</h1>
                <p>Lack of Devices and Interaction with the audience
                    Due to a lack of devices, we couldn't interact much with the viewers. The phone used for streaming was also being used by one of our players to show the game on the stream. The players were focused on winning, and the other speakers were busy watching the game.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Lighting of the video
                    Since the ring light we were supposed to use was broken, we had to rely on the ceiling light, which made it hard for our viewers to see us clearly.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                
                    Streaming App
                    Since we got confused on how to use Twitch properly, we had to switch from Twitch to TikTok so we can control our stream easily.

                        <h1>Level of Engagement</h1>
                        <p>The stream had a good level of engagement, with 85 viewers and 24 comments, showing active audience participation and interest in the content. However, some interactions were missed due to the players being focused on the game and answering questions. This limited the full potential for engagement, as responding to more comments could have strengthened the connection with viewers and encouraged further participation.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Better interaction management could have increased audience involvement, possibly leading to more comments and discussions. While the high engagement was a positive outcome, improving how interactions were handled could have further enhanced the overall performance and effectiveness of the stream.

                                    <br>
                                    Since we didnâ€™t know how to properly use Twitch for streaming, we spent an hour trying to figure out the controls and how to start the stream. After struggling for a while, we decided to switch to TikTok instead. Because of this, our stream was delayed by an hour.
                                    </p>

The stream had a total of 85 viewers, it had a total of 9 peak concurrent viewers with the duration of our 1 hour and 1-minute stream, a total of 65 unique viewers with an average watch duration of 3 minutes and 22 seconds, and a total of 4 average concurrent viewers.

                                        This shows how many people took an interest in our stream by promoting it on our social media platforms, every post of our promotion had a minimum of 40 engagements, and the total of our promotion views is 325. Due to our views being below a hundred, this may have been caused by the scheduling of our stream as we kept changing the dates because of our busy schedule and people may have been confused or didn't have any interest as the dates kept changing.
